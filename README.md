Objective: Use a number of fundamental data structures to implement the Multiset abstract data type.

Task: Implement Multiset using Different Data Structures (7 marks)

In this task, you will implement the multiset abstract data type using data structures, including:
1. doubly linked list,
2. sorted (doubly) linked list,
3. binary search tree.

Your implementation should support the following operations:
• Create an empty multiset (implemented as a constructor that takes zero arguments). • Add an element.
• Search for an element.
• Remove all instances of an element.
• Remove one instance of an element.
• Print out the multiset.
